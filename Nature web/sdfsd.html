    <h1><span>Nature</span> of the <span>Pure</span></h1>
    <p>
      We can’t live without fresh air, <br />
      clean water, sunshine and a lot of things which we take from the nature.
      <br />
      That's why we must take care of it. We must keep our rivers and lakes,
      <br />
      forests and towns clean. We must take care of each plant and each animal.
      <br />
      We must plant flowers — not pick them up, feed birds and animals in winter
      — not kill them. <br />
      Then we'll be happy to live on the most beautiful planet in the Universe.
